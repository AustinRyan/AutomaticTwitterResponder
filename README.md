# AutomaticTwitterResponder
This twitter bot uses twitters api and will automatically respond to tweets the @ you and use the hashtag #helloworld. I followed CS Dojo's video on YouTube on how to create a Twitter Bot to create this. This project/video lesson is just to help me understand APIs better and understand Twitter's API more in depth. Not going to lie the functions where the last seen ID is stored into a seperate file confused me a lot but I got the basic understanding of it.
